This project is a part of Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/hzmoNKtzvAzXsEqx8/Data-Analytics-Virtual-Experience). The main goal of this project is to help a social media client called "Social Buzz" solving their problems in which they have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of **Accenture Team** to oversee
their scaling process effectively.

Three main objectives based on the client's problems are,
1. An audit of their big data practice
2. Recommendations for a successful IPO
3. An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the
largest aggregate popularity

As a Data Analyst at Accenture North America, **My main task** is to provide an analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity by applying data analytics and visualization skills into massive amount of data provided by the client.

## Final result
The final result can be seen in Power Power given by this [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qyHyHXD0q6rYz_h4ZFQjN0dgRkyn1D8_bodHKTUV7qI/edit?usp=sharing), or downloaded via this [link](https://github.com/dstito/Analyzing-Social-Buzz-Content-Categories/blob/main/PPT%20-%20Social%20Buzz%20Project.pptx)

I also provide an interactive dashboard to assist the client to make their own analysis, and you can see it on Tableau Public given by this [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/SocialBuzzDashboard_16980741281140/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
