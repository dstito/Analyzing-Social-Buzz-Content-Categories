This project is a part of Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/hzmoNKtzvAzXsEqx8/Data-Analytics-Virtual-Experience). The main goal of this project is to help a social media client called "Social Buzz" solving their problems in which they have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of **Accenture Team** to oversee
their scaling process effectively.

Three main objectives based on the client's problems are,
1. An audit of their big data practice
2. Recommendations for a successful IPO
3. An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the
largest aggregate popularity

As a Data Analyst at Accenture North America, **My main task** is to provide an analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity by applying data analytics and visualization skills into massive amount of data provided by the client.
